Two separate visits she swayed me away from a more expensive procedure that I was going in for, in favor of a less expensive procedure that she felt was more right for my skin. She's honest about what she feels is best for your skin."

Everyone is patient and they answer my questions and concerns without forcing you into buying something, which is something I've experienced at other skin care businesses. My treatment results are always consistent and good. Nicole's very passionate about her business and she seems very eager to learn more about her profession and I feel secure in her hands."
